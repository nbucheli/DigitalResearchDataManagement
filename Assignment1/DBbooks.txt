## An important thing about SQL: all the table names and column names have
## to be one word! I have fixed up your files to reflect this.


book
*id integer
- title text
- authors text
- publication_year date
- publisher text

people
* id integer
- name text
- adress text
- email_adress text
- phone_number text
#is phone number really text? I don't want to do any calculations with this & if I make it a number, there could be trouble with excel etc.
# -- Then yes, making it a text field is fine.


borrowing_process
* id integer
- book_title => book.id
- mode_of_borrowing text
- starting date 
- due date
- return_date date
- borrower => people.id

#mode of borrowing could be s.th. as "asked for by e-mail"/face-to-face
## You didn't specify a data type for this, so I put 'text'. Another option
## would be to have another table listing all the allowed modes of borrowing,
## and have mode_of_borrowing in this table contain a reference to that one.
